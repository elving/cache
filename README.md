# Cache

![Project unmaintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-unmaintained-red.svg)

Back in July of 2015 I launched a product called "Cache", a bookmarking service that let users save any type of content from webpages like text, images, videos and audio with [integrations from popular websites and services](http://trycache.tumblr.com/post/142844905996/cache-is-shutting-down). 

It went on to have 3000+ active users who saved more than 17,000 links. The backend was dependent on the [Parse Platform](https://parseplatform.org/) so when Facebook decided to buy and kill the service [I decided to stop working on it](http://trycache.tumblr.com/post/142844905996/cache-is-shutting-down) because I didn’t had the time or resources to maintain the backend on my own.

The app is very outdated; It runs on React 0.13, Flux and an ancient version of Parse 😱 so getting this thing to run would be crazy. 

The only reason I’m “open sourcing” this beast is to share a tiny part of my past… To wallow in nostalgia ✌.
