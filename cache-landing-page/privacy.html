        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This online service (trycache.co) as well as browser extensions and apps provided by this service are collectively referred to as "Cache" in these Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Fundamental principles regarding your privacy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
          <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
          <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
          <li>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Website Visitors</h4>
        <p>Like most online services, Cache collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cache’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how it's users use Cache. From time to time, Cache may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends of usage.</p>
        <p>Cache also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.</p>
        <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
        <p>Certain visitors choose to interact with Cache in ways that require the gathering of personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cache gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Cache are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Cache collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Cache. Cache does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
        <p>This Application does not support “do not track” requests.</p>
        <h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
        <p>Cache may collect statistics about the behavior of it's users. For instance, Cache may monitor the most popular links or screen the links help identify spam. Cache may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Cache does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
        <h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
        <p>Cache discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Cache's behalf or to provide services available at Cache, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Cache, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Cache will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Cache discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Cache believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Cache, third parties or the public at large.</p>
        <p>If you are a registered user of Cache and have supplied your email address, Cache may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Cache. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Cache takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Cache uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage, and their preferences. Cache visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Cache, with the drawback that certain features of Cache may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
        <h4>Business Transfers</h4>
        <p>If Cache, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Cache goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Cache may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
        <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Cache may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Cache’s sole discretion. Cache encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use Cache after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
